                        <p>The national poet Shaaban Robert expressed the deep love for his motherland and his
                            language
                            in the poem ‘YAITWA TITI LA MAMA’. He wrote:</p>
                        <p>‘Ni sawa na manukato, moyoni mwangu na pua,
                            Pori, bahari na mto, napita nikitumia,
                            Titi la mama litamu, jingine halishi hamu.’
                        </p>
                        <p>Shaaban Robert has perfectly woven this love and his serving for the country into his
                            writings, which are all about the greatness of humanity and the great country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Economically, Tanzania has realized annual growth between 6% and 8% in the past decade
                            due
                            to strong and consistent economic management. Culturally, Tanzania is one of the most
                            diverse countries in the world, from a delightful mix of influences with over 120
                            tribes.<span id="dots">..</span>
                        </p>
                        <span id="showMoreCEO">
                            <p>Under Tanzania’s Second Five Year Development Plan 2016/17–2020/21, almost all major
                                sectors have witnessed fast growth. Manufacturing is gathering momentum after years
                                of
                                decline. Tanzania now produces cement, textiles, ceramics and machinery. Mining and
                                manufacturing have attracted foreign direct investment of at least $1bn a year in
                                the
                                past 5 years.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, the
                                Tanzanian Government, through the National Information and Communications Technology
                                Policy, recognizes that effective use of ICT is a critical foundation that cuts
                                cross
                                all sectors for rapid socio-economic growth, in its aspiration to become a
                                middle-income
                                country by 2025. As we all know, this target was achieved 5 years earlier than
                                expected.
                            </p>
                            <p>The efforts made by the Government as well as those from the Private Sector in ICT
                                have
                                boosted the industry and socio-economic activities. The number of mobile phone
                                subscribers have increased by 23% in the past 5 years to 49.2 Million by 2020 while
                                the
                                number of Internet users has increased by 62% in the same period to 27.9 Million by
                                2020.</p>
                            <p>In 2017 Oxford Economics released the Digital Spillover report on the impact of the
                                digital economy. Their analysis suggests that over the past three decades, a USD 1
                                investment in digital technologies has, on average, led to a USD 20 rise in Gross
                                Domestic Product. In the next five years, we envision and firmly believe that, with
                                the
                                leadership of the newly established Ministry of Communications and Information
                                Technology, ICT will be adopted and utilized widely in all major economic activities
                                and
                                continue to bring great changes to the country.</p>
                            <p>People are always at the center of change. In the series of short films that we
                                produced
                                recently, you can see real impact on people’s lives. There is a girl, Noreen Kira,
                                who
                                has utilized ICTs to transform her family business into a digitally managed
                                business.
                                She said, as an entrepreneur who studied Electronics and Telecommunication
                                Engineering,
                                that she is always seeking to innovate new ways of doing the same old things.
                            </p>
                            <p>A lecturer at Huawei’s ICT academy in Dar es Salaam University, Emanuel Chaula, after
                                winning the Huawei Global ICT competition in 2019, decided to dedicate himself to
                                passing his knowledge and skills to students with the same talents and passion in
                                ICT to
                                prepare them for the opportunities brought by the digital era.</p>
                            <p>You can also see a businessman, Dr. Gilliard Loth, whose company in the
                                telecommunications business has grown ten-fold to 100 employees in the past decade,
                                thanks to the fast pace of growth of the ICT sector in Tanzania. The growth of his
                                business, he says, teaches a great lesson that an opportunity shared is actually an
                                opportunity doubled.</p>
                            <p>It was so touching when I saw one day one of our Tanzanian solution managers, Benson
                                Kyambile, trying to teach his 7-year-old daughter to draw a picture of a
                                communications
                                tower. He then told me he inherited the dream of becoming a telecommunications
                                engineer
                                form his mother. With the dream realized, now he wants to pass the passion down to
                                his
                                two daughters.</p>
                            <p>These are real people with real changes happening in their lives. I believe their
                                experiences reveal how powerful ICT is in connecting us with great ideas and
                                opportunities for a better life and a bright future. It is tens of millions of these
                                hard working and entrepreneurial ‘U’ make up this great country. This what the theme
                                of
                                the film production project ‘Opportunities that work 4U’ means.</p>
                            <p>As a leading global ICT company, Huawei is ready, willing and able to be part of
                                Tanzania’s successful story. The reason why I say so is because of what we have done
                                and

                            <p>The beauty and greatness of Tanzania resides not only in its spectacular landscape,
                                strategic location and diverse resources, but also in its people, not just the ‘poet
                                laureate of Swahili’, but every ordinary Tanzanian citizen. With ICTs, the most

                                    <p>At 24, Noreen owns a bakery. After graduated from the Dar es Salaam Institute

                                        the outskirts of Dar es Salaam since 2013. In the beginning, my mom used to

                                        cakes and bread at home, mainly depending on neighbors and passers-by to

                                            Huawei Tanzania, to attend a Corporate Social Responsibility program of

                                        <p>In the 14-day sponsored trip to China, Noreen got exposure to
                                            cutting-edge
                                            technologies and received hands-on technical practice at Huawei

                                            in Shenzhen, China. The trip inspired Noreen to think creatively.
                                            “While in China, I learnt a valuable lesson on how business is being
                                            conducted through mobile transactions. People hardly carry cash in
                                            China,”
                                            she says.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Coming back from China Noreen started to move some operations of her
                                            business
                                            online.
                                            Noreen uses social media platforms to reach her customers. She keeps
                                            updating her customers’ records so as to allow them to place orders and
                                            get
                                            prompt delivery. As a result, she sees her business gradually
                                            transforming.
                                            “ In the past, we were limited to few customers, but for now, life has
                                            changed, I am able to score potential customers digitally,” she says.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>“I have now built a network of customers, some I know and I some I do not
                                            know. I can share with them pleasant photos of my products. I have also
                                            joined paid advertisements, and it helps a lot in increasing orders
                                            especially during festival seasons. Since then my business has grown so
                                            rapidly,” she says.
                                            She does prompt cake delivery services around Dar es Salaam and Coast
                                            regions, and in some cases, she supplies beyond the two regions. She is
                                            now
                                            able to drive her life and that of her family through her business.

                                        <p>As digital entrepreneurship is growing in Tanzania, Noreen believes that
                                            to a

                                            their competitiveness in the job market, since digital skills are
                                            usually
                                            the essential entry requirements.
                                            “It is important for youths to place themselves advantageously in this
                                            digital era. It is time for them to get digital skillsets to be more
                                            competent in the job market or to be able to start their own
                                            businesses,”
                                            she advises.

                                        <p>With the online business growing, Noreen plans to open another 2 shops in

                                            “I am so happy to see my business growing, but what makes me happier is

                                        <p>Speaking of the company’s extensive capabilities, Dr Loth introduced that
                                            not
                                            only they conduct passive management of sites, such as the provision of
                                            generators and attending problems related to power in telecommunication
                                            towers; but also they do the active part of the towers, namely improving
                                            radio communication, which is their major task nowadays.</p>
                                        <p>The company also does the installation of various tools. Currently, the
                                            company is working on the upgrading of a mobile company’s services.</p>
                                        <p>During the course of cooperating with Huawei, Dr Loth’s company also has
                                            opportunities to deploy its staff to China to learn new technologies.
                                            After
                                            they come back with more experience, some of them are allocated to work
                                            in
                                            the field with higher efficiency, the others work as trainers to pass
                                            their
                                            experience to more employees.</p>
                                        <p>“After a capacity building supported by Huawei, including expertise
                                            transfer
                                            and introducing modern ICT equipment, we are able to deliver quick,
                                            efficient, and better services to our clients, and have managed to
                                            spread
                                            our wings at almost every corner of this country. We have engineers all
                                            over
                                            the country,” he adds.</p>
                                        <p>Dr Loth said the partnership with Huawei has seen the company registering
                                            robust growth and has achieved the stature of being an international
                                            brand
                                            that matches up with international standards.
                                            “After partnering with Huawei, we have grown up almost ten folds with at
                                            least 100 employees and with a much more good office at this magnificent
                                            newly built NSSSF Tower here at Sam Nujuma Road,” he says. Over time,
                                            the
                                            company has built a strong reputation and received more opportunities to
                                            further expanding its business.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>It has plans to expand into neighbouring countries, including Zambia,
                                            Mozambique, and South Africa, it is also invited to conduct business in
                                            Ethiopia.
                                            Recounting on the company’s growth from a meagre one-room office to a
                                            regionally recognized company, Dr Loth pays a glowing tribute to the
                                            government of Tanzania for providing an enabling environment for local
                                            companies to grow and partner with foreign companies for a broader
                                            vision.
                                            In return, the company also strives to repay the country.

                                        <p>“We are proud to have created 100 direct employment opportunities, which
                                            means that behind each of our employees, there are at least five to six
                                            dependents and this is a huge thing to our country’s economy,” he says.

                                        economy as several entities in this sector have worked hard on promoting
                                        socio-economic development and creating many employment opportunities.</p>
                                    <p>Benson Kyambile, a 36-year-old, is one of those who got involved
                                        in the telecommunications sector, saying his mother, who had previously
                                        worked
                                        in the telecommunication industry for nearly three decades, inspired him to

                                        <p>He says very few Tanzanians had an idea by then that the world could
                                            technologically be so fast-changing to let ICT running the world.</p>
                                        <p>Having considered that fact, in 2005, he secured a scholarship to go to
                                            China, where he made his undergraduate studies in telecommunications.

                                        <p>“Huawei trained me on various aspects of telecommunications-related

                                            According to him, there are also plenty of Tanzanians like him within

                                            Tanzania has grown to a great extent, not only for the investment it

                                            but also for the operational expertise, which accompanies the

                                            He also mentions that while Tanzania is in the 4G internet system, some
                                            of

                                            how far they can go to make things faster through the internet. We,
                                            Tanzanians, should not lag behind, we should also go parallel with
